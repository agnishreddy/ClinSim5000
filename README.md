# ClinSim5000: Simulated Clinical Trial Dataset  

## Overview  
**ClinSim5000** is a simulated clinical trial dataset project developed in R. It showcases data generation, analysis, and visualization skills for clinical programming applications in pharmaceutical and healthcare research. The dataset includes 5,000 patients with demographic, treatment, and outcome data.

This project highlights:  
- **End-to-end clinical data workflows**: From data simulation to insights.  
- **Advanced R programming techniques**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Custom visualizations**: To interpret and communicate findings effectively.  

---

## Features  
- **Patient demographics**: Includes age, gender, and treatment assignments.  
- **Clinical metrics**: Baseline and follow-up blood pressure, adverse events, and response status.  
- **Data analysis**: Summaries for treatment groups, adverse events, and demographic patterns.  
- **Visualizations**: Age distribution and blood pressure changes across treatments.

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Install **R** (version 4.0 or later).  
- Install the following R libraries:  
  ```R
  install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))
  ```

### Steps  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ClinSim5000.git
   cd ClinSim5000
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   - Open `ClinSim5000.R` in RStudio.  
   - Run the script to generate the dataset and visualizations.  

3. **Outputs**  
   - `clinical_trial_data.csv`: The simulated dataset.  
   - Visualizations in the Plots pane or saved as PNG files (if enabled).

## Example Insights  
### 1. **Demographics Summary**  
- Gender distribution: ~48% Male, ~52% Female.  
- Average age: 54 years.  

### 2. **Treatment Effects**  
- Significant blood pressure reductions in **Drug A** and **Drug B** groups compared to Placebo.  

### 3. **Adverse Event Distribution**  
- 70% of patients reported no adverse events.
